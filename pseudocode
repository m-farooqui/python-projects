#The function takes in text from a article or book. Declare all the local variables also create a varible score to hold the final score
Define a function compute_readability(text):
     Declare a variable total words and set to 0.
     Declare a variable total sentences and set to 0
     Declare a variable total syllables and set to 0
     Declare a varaible score and set to 0.
 
     Assign variable total words to results of calling the function count words(text)
     Assign variable total sentences to results calling the function count_sentences(text)
     Assign variable total syllables to results of calling the function count_syllables(text)
 #Use the formula to compute the score    
     Assign variable score to 
              206.835 - 1.015 * (total_words/total_sentences) - 84.6 * (total_syllables/total_words)
 #After getting the score map that to a reading level            
     if score >= 90:
            Print 'Reading level of 5th grade'
     elif scores >= 80:
            Print 'Reading level of 6th grade'
     elif scores >= 70:
          Print'Reading level of 7th grade'
     elif scores >= 60:
          Print'Reading level of 8-9th grade'
     elif scores >= 50:
          Print'Reading level of 10-12th grade'
     elif scores >= 30:
          Print'Reading level of college student'
     else:
          Print'Reading level of college graduate'
